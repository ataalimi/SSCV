SSCV
====

### Introduction

SSCV is an open source MATLAB implementation of the super sparse coding vector (SSCV) for human activity recognition. This package illustrates how to compute SSCV on the YouTube dataset. 


### Dependency

The code depends on [SPAMS](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html) library which is enclosed in the package. If it is not compatible with your platform, please download and setup accordingly. 

Please also extract [STIP](http://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/interestpoints.html) features of the [YouTube](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_YouTube_Action.php) dataset and put them under "./Feats/STIP/" according to the structures and names in this dataset.   


### Bugs and Extension
